**Q10: Student interface, Athlete and TennisPlayer Class**
<br> 
` Consider the following interface and class declarations. `

An 8-line code segment reads as follows. 
Line 1: public interface Student. 
Line 2: open brace, forward slash, asterisk, implementation not shown, asterisk, forward slash, close brace. 
Line 3: blank.
Line 4: public class Athlete. 
Line 5: open brace, forward slash, asterisk, implementation not shown, asterisk, forward slash, close brace. 
Line 6: blank.
Line 7: public class Tennis Player extends Athlete implements Student. 
Line 8: open brace, forward slash, asterisk, implementation not shown, asterisk, forward slash, close brace.

Assume that each class has a zero-parameter constructor. Which of the following is NOT a valid declaration? `
<br> <br>
**Correct Answer:** *D. Student d = new Athlete();* <br> A subclass cannot call a parent class. <br> <br>
**My Answer:** *C. Athlete c = new TennisPlayer();* <br> I thought that I could not call a parent class could call a subclass, when it was actually the other way around.

**Correct Answer:** *D. II and III only* <br>  <br> <br>
**My Answer:** *C. I and III only* <br> I thought that I could not call a parent class could call a subclass, when it was actually the other way around.
