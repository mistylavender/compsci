## Tech Talk 0 - Data Structures ##

* Data Structures
  * meant to organize data
  * primitive data: a variable holding a single value (integer, float, string, boolean) 
  * non-primitive data: a sequence / table of data or databases (array, list, dictionary, set, file)
  * algorithms interact with the data structures to get data and 


  * stacks and queues are more important in lists
  * tuple & dictionary - hashmap for python and java respectively
  * Imperative and Procedural Programming:
  * usually use code in a sequence and if repetitive it can be put into a procedures -> procedural programming
  * procedures enhance imperative paradigm / improve quality
  * "Press 1 to go here Press 2 to go here" / menus -> sequence of events to choose and then choose a specific procedure
  * object oriented -> hello "object" which method would you like me to execute for you -> knows concept of classes and objects, knows gives specific solution/method for object
  * uml/class chart (object) vs flowchart (procedural)



  * Data Structures: need structures to input data and need algorithm to put to use
  * array vs hashmap: 
  * array stores primitive types, index for each value (nondirect)
  * hashmap stores in key value pairs (direct access)

```java code```

  * goal: make a data structure and makes a menu -> try and catch / except or array -> should be able to work with a different value of numbers
