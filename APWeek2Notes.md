## Study Plan for Week

* Monday: Review of CollegeBoard Videos: Classes and Objects Terminology and Review (where I lack most on)
* Tuesday: Take full 2020 MCQ 
* Wednesday: Take corrections of the MCQ, retake the ending part of the MCQ to see full score, and finish up terminology with any other review
* Thursday: Take full 2020 FRQ
* Friday: Finish FRQ + code on REPL + keep track of errors and report in notes

All of the following should be placed below or in the review ticket: [TICKET](https://github.com/mistylavender/techtalks/issues/3#issue-1207182795)

## Notes for AP Week: Revision of Terminology for Classes/Objects

* Encapsulation: using a class to hide the state (data)  and the behavior (method)

* Final variables: once set, variables cannot be changed

* Final class: cannot have subclasses

* Final method: method cannot be overridden in the subclass

* Default Constructor: constructor without arguments / inputs

* Constructor: initialization of a class, called automatically w/ the class

* Instantiation: calls the object of the class to run it

* Initialization: putting default values to input later

* Accessor Method: accesses data in object without alteration (ex: getters, setters)

* Mutator Method: changes states of data in object

* Instance method: a method that operate on individual objects

* Static method / Class method: a method that performs operations for entire classes, instead of just objects, often uses keyword static in header, can use a static variable in its code

* Static methods in Driver Class: when driver method is static, all the other methods that are running also have to be static

* Method Overloading: multiple methods in the same class with same names but different parameters, return type is irrelevant but input type(s) matters
EX: having multiple constructors with different arguments

* Scope: region that a variable or method can be accessed

* Block: piece of code within a {} -> can be a method, class, if-else statement, etc.

* Local variable: defined inside a method instead of without or within a statement -> declared to end of the block

* this Keyword: used to implement instance methods/variables, often used if needs to be called from outside the method/class, 

* implicit parameter: parameter for an instance method

* passing primitives as parameters: passed by value, primitive types must be stored in memory, when method is exited, local memory slots are exited

* Passive objects as parameters: address/reference of the object is copied instead of the values of the objects -> cannot replace the objects later, but can change the state of the objects 

* Null Reference: defines a reference that is uninitialized, null/no value in place, can input value later
EX: BankAccount b;

* An abstract class allows you to create functionality that subclasses can implement or override. 
* An interface only allows you to define functionality, static variables
* Can extend a single abstract classes, can implement multiple interfaces

* [type] [name] = new [instantiation/memory type]([parameter])

* compiles based on type, allocates memory to instantiation
